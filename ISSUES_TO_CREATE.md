# Issues to Create

A comprehensive scan of the repository was performed to identify `TODO` and `FIXME` comments.

**Scan Results:**
- No actionable `TODO` or `FIXME` comments were found in the source code.

**Notes:**
- The file `dbt_silver_gold/scripts/generate_docs.py` contains the string `"TODO: Add description"` in two places. These are functional return values used when description generation fails, and not code comments requiring developer attention.
