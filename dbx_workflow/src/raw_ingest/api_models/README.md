# Auto-generated API Models

The files in this directory are automatically generated by the `daily_schema_check.yml` workflow, which runs `dbx_workflow/scripts/check_api_schemas.py`.

These models represent the response schemas of the external APIs we consume:
- `coinbase.py`: Coinbase API response (Candles).
- `frankfurter.py`: Frankfurter API response (Time Series).

**Do not edit these files manually.** Any changes will be overwritten by the automated process.
If the schema changes, the workflow will detect it and create a Pull Request with the updated models.
